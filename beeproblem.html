For some it may be a simple trowel and watering can, for others it might be giant threshing machines and sprinklers that span the length of an entire field; for us, it's the honeybee. They're the most successful pollinators in the world, pollinating 80% of all flowering plants, and their ceaseless efforts are behind one of every three bites you eat. These tiny marvels are what make food production possible, and they are in danger. Pesticides, diseases and parasites, and environmental destruction have all had a hand in a phenomena called colony collapse disorder. Read on to learn more about the role of honeybees in the environment and why it's so important that we protect them.</font>

     <style="text-align:center;"><font size="4">Bees, like us, our social creatures. They live in huge hives of up to 80,000 bees consisting of a single queen, male drones, female worker bees, and larvae. They communicate through pheromones and complex dances, and their social structures are studied by many entomologists because of their intricacy.
